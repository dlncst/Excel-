# Project #1 Excel

This project includes data trasformation and cleaning by removing duplicates, finding and replacing values, creating new worksheets, creating pivot tables and table relationship, visual dashboard. In the comparison screenshot below you can see some of the changes applied from the original dataset 'Buyers' and the 'Working Sheet' which reflects changes made to data. Changes include: finding and replacing M values for Married on the Marital Status Column as well as S to Single on the same column. Similarly, on the Gender column F was changed to Female and M to Male. Duplicate values were removed to reflect single data rows only.
